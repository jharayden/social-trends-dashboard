A dashboard for the end term presentation for a freshmen student in HKUST(GZ)
The dashboard is about showing each country's happiness score as well as using an AI-empowered model to showcase the ways to evaluate the happiness score from the dimensions of GDP, education and lifespan.
The dashboard would also give you a analysis about the K-means cluster of the country and some brief policy recommendations.
All in all, just a web created to get a higher GPA, a little tryout in this field.
